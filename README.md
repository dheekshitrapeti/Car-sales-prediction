# Car Sales Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting car purchase amounts using machine learning. The model is built based on various customer attributes like age, annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth. The objective is to help businesses optimize their marketing strategies by identifying key factors influencing car sales.

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer demographics and financial details:

- Customer Name
- Customer Email
- Country
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Salary
- Credit Card Debt
- Net Worth
- Car Purchase Amount (Target Variable)
## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing
1. Handling missing values
2. Detecting outliers
3. Feature scaling
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Customer segmentation based on clustering
2. Relationship analysis between key factors and car purchase amount
3. Visualization of spending patterns
### Model Selection & Training
1. Implemented Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Polynomial Regression
2. Evaluated models using RÂ² score
### Results & Insights
1. Identified key customer attributes affecting car purchases
2. Clustered customers based on age and net worth to analyze spending behavior
### Key Visualizations
1. Customer Segmentation: Age vs Net Worth
2. Spending Analysis Across Clusters
## Results

- Best Model: Ridge Regression (RÂ² Score: 0.9862)
- The model effectively predicts car purchase amounts based on customer attributes.
